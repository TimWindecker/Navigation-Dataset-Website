## Help Us Build a Robot Navigation Dataset!

We are collecting photos of real-world locations to help advance robotics research. Your photos will be used to create navigation challenges for different embodiments: human, bicycle, legged robot, and wheeled robot. Each image will be annotated with possible paths and instructions, then used to evaluate and train intelligent navigation models.

### How You Can Help

1. **Find an Interesting Spot:**  
   Take a photo of a place that would be challenging to move through for a person, bicyclist, legged robot, or wheeled robot. Good examples are tricky staircases, crowded hallways, ramps, or spaces with obstacles. Check out the example images below for inspiration.

2. **Take a Clear Photo:**  
   Try to capture the full area and make sure the challenge is visible.  
   Donâ€™t worry if people or license plates appear in your photo since we will anonymize them before publishing the data.

3. **Upload Your Photo:**  
   - Enter your **first and last name**. Don't worry, we will anonymize your name as well.
   - Add the image location in the format: `city, country`.
   - Upload your image using the form below.
