## Help Us Build a Robot Navigation Dataset!

We are collecting photos of real-world locations to help advance robotics research. Your photos will be used to create navigation challenges for different embodiments: human, bicycle, legged robot, and wheeled robot. Each image will be annotated with possible paths and instructions, then used to evaluate and train intelligent navigation models.

### How You Can Help

1. **Find an Interesting Spot:**
   Take a photo of a place that would be challenging to move through for a person, bicyclist, legged robot, or wheeled robot. Good examples include tricky staircases, crowded hallways, ramps, or spaces with obstacles. In such scenarios, you usually have to think a bit about how to get through, even as a human. Check out the example images below for inspiration.

2. **Take a Clear Photo:**
   Try to capture the entire area from a first-person perspective, as if you are standing there and looking at the scene. Make sure the challenge is clearly visible. Donâ€™t worry if people or license plates appear in your photo, as we will anonymize them before publishing the data.

3. **Upload Your Photo:**
   - Enter your **first and last name**. Don't worry, we will anonymize your name as well.
   - Add the image location in the format: **city, country**.
   - Upload your image using the form below.
