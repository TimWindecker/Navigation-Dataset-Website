We are currently working on a benchmark dataset for robot navigation. The purpose of this dataset is to train a Vision Language Action model (VLA) for navigation by giving it challenges that are embodiment specific (e.g. for a legged robot, wheeled robot, human or bicycle). Such a challenge consists of an image, a question and is labeled with lines that describe the path of an embodiment.

For instance, challenges can be of [these categories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZCAFuhysvMgYD59tLc6PS9ymTSHZQCMO8jVJcaYtH8U/edit?usp=sharing). If you'd like some more inspiration, have a look at [these example images](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XA9qubRphn1B40ZKHHjOPL-juS73QA5eL7zHYofl85Q/edit?usp=sharing) or [these challenge scenarios](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wXNG6oAHVrIziMwT-qGzZdpHO6OJDQ_n6yCWKNhLvBo/edit?usp=sharing) that were generated by ChatGPT.

If you find any interesting spots in your daily environment, we'd really appreciate it if you take a picture of these scenarios and share them with us. You can use the form below to send us your images. We don't really need you full name, please just pick an identifier. Also it would be great if you could tell us the city or country where you took the pictures.
